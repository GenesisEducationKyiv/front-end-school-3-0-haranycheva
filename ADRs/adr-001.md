# ADR-001: Migration to TypeScript

## Context  
The project was initially developed using JavaScript due to its simplicity and flexibility. However, at the current stage, there's a growing need to improve code quality, simplify maintenance, and support scaling.

## Decision  
Rewrite the player component from JavaScript to TypeScript.

## Rationale  
TypeScript allows us to:
- Improve code readability
- Catch errors at compile time
- Get better autocomplete and type suggestions during development
- Simplify project scaling

## Status  
Proposed

## Consequences  
**Positive:**
- Improved code readability  
- Lower risk of runtime errors  
- Easier project scalability

**Negative:**
- TypeScript requires more initial development time  
- Potential difficulties integrating certain libraries
