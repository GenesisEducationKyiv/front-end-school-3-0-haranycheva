# ADR-003: Project Architecture Refactoring

## Context  
The project structure was created without following clear architectural principles. As the number of components and logic grows, it becomes harder to navigate, reuse code, and avoid duplication.

## Decision  
Refactor the project structure using a modular architecture,  partially influenced by Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) principles (https://www.figma.com/board/P7dtvyqgXlsDANNqLK3x07/Untitled?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=SJap0ddd).Code will be organized by roles there (components/, api/, hooks/, store/) and /components is organized by functions (/modules, /widgets, /ui) That will separate logic into reusable and well-organized modules. This hybrid approach allows for scalable, maintainable, and flexible project growth, while avoiding the complexity of full FSD adoption.

## Rationale  
A better-structured architecture will:
- Provides better isolation of responsibilities and simplifies testing and onboarding.
- The hybrid FSD and module system approach supports future growth, allowing new features to be added with minimal structural changes.
- Improve code readability

## Status  
Proposed

## Consequences  
**Positive:**
- Code is better organized and easier to understand  
- Easier to add new features  
- Reduced imports and tighter dependencies

**Negative:**
- Refactoring will require time and effort  
- May be confusing at first due to unfamiliarity with the new structure
