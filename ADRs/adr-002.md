# ADR-002: Adding try/catch blocks to API Requests

## Context  
The project uses asynchronous functions to handle API requests. Not all requests are currently wrapped in try/catch blocks, that can lead to unexpected crashes, especially when the server is temporarily unavailable or returns an error.

## Decision  
Wrap all asynchronous API requests in try/catch blocks.

## Rationale  
Adding error handling via try/catch will:
- Make debugging faster
- Prevent the app from crashing unexpectedly
- Improve user experience

## Status  
Proposed

## Consequences  
**Positive:**
- Easier testing and debugging  
- The app becomes more resilient to failures  
- Better UX

**Negative:**
- Increased amount of code  
- Requires a unified approach to displaying error messages
